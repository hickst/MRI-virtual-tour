## MRI Scanner Virtual Tour

This repository implements a 3D virtual tour of the research MRI scanning facility at the [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu). The research MRI center is a heavily scheduled and restricted access facility. The author's hope is that this virtual tour can serve both to document the facility and to educate current and potential neuroimaging researchers about the resources it offers.

### About

This virtual tour was developed by
[Dr. Dianne Patterson](https://profiles.arizona.edu/person/dkp)
of the [Brain Imaging Center (BIC)](https://www.bic.arizona.edu/)
and Tom Hicks, in the [School of Information](https://ischool.arizona.edu/).
We are grateful to the [RII Sensor Lab](https://sensorlab.arizona.edu/),
for the loan of several 360 cameras, and to Devin Bayly, of UITS, for
providing us with example AFrame code to jumpstart our learning.

The tour is implemented using HTML, Javascript, the
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) frontend toolkit, and the
[AFrame](https://aframe.io) web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences.
