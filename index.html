        <h1>MRI Scanner Virtual Tour</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to a virtual tour of the U of Arizona's research MRI scanner facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our 3T research scanner is located in the basement of the Biosciences
          Research Laboratories (BSRL) building.
          It is administered by the Translational Bioimaging Resource (TBIR) group,
          under the auspices of the Office for Research, Innovation, and Impact (RII).
        </p>


        <h2>Taking the Virtual Tour</h2>
        <p>
          The tour uses "flat 3D" technology, which should be supported by modern
          browsers which implement WebGL (for example: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge).
        </p>
        <p>
          On 3D pages, dragging your mouse should rotate the virtual enviroment and
          allow you to see the room from various angles. Note that because each 3D
          scene was captured by a 3D camera at a fixed point, you cannot move into
          or out of the scene, only rotate at the camera's fixed location.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you look around the various scenes, you will see bright blue spheres,
          we call "infospheres". Clicking on one of the infospheres will pop up
          a window with more information about the object which the infosphere is
          hovering near. All popups should close when the "X" button in the upper
          right corner of the popup is clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the initial scene (the Console Room) you will see a red and a green
          plane, each covering a desk cluttered with devices related to the
          operation and/or use of the MRI. Clicking on either the red or the
          green plane will take you to a 2D page which provides more detailed
          information about the objects under that plane. The close button, a
          black "X" in the upper right corner of each 2D page, will return
          you to the main Console Room scene when clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the floor of 3D scenes, you may notice black discs with double arrows.
          Clicking on one of these will navigate you to the next or previous scene.
        </p>

        <h3>About The Tour</h3>
        <p>
          This virtual tour was developed by
          <a href="https://profiles.arizona.edu/person/dkp">Dr. Dianne Patterson</a>,
          of the <a href="https://www.bic.arizona.edu/">Brain Imaging Center (BIC)</a>,
          and Tom Hicks, in the
          <a href="https://ischool.arizona.edu/">School of Information</a>.
          We are grateful to Devin Bayly, of UITS, for providing us with example
          AFrame code to jumpstart our learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tour is implemented using HTML, Javascript, the
          <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> frontend toolkit, and the
          <a href="https://aframe.io">AFrame</a> web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences.
