        <p>
          Welcome to a virtual tour of the University of Arizona's
          research MRI scanning facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our 3T research scanner is located in the basement of the Biosciences
          Research Laboratories (BSRL) building.
          It is administered by the Translational Bioimaging Resource (TBIR) group,
          under the auspices of the Office for Research, Innovation, and Impact (RII).
        </p>


        <h2>Taking the Virtual Tour</h2>
        <p>
          The tour uses "flat 3D" technology, which should be supported by all modern
          browsers which implement WebGL (for example: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge).
          For best viewing, we recommend a window size of at least 1800 x 1200, although
          smaller sizes should work (you'll just have to move around more).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tour-how-hdr">Movement:</span>
          On 3D pages, dragging your mouse should rotate the virtual enviroment and
          allow you to see the room from various angles. Note, that because each 3D
          scene was captured by a 3D camera at a fixed point, you cannot move into
          or out of the scene, only rotate at the camera's fixed location.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tour-how-hdr">Information:</span>
          As you look around the various scenes, you will see bright blue spheres,
          we call <i>infospheres</i>. Clicking on one of the infospheres will pop up
          a window with more information about the object which the infosphere is
          hovering near. All popups should close when the <b>X</b> button in the upper
          right corner of the popup is clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tour-how-hdr">More Info (2D):</span>
          In the initial scene (the MRI Console Room) you will see a red and a green
          plane, each covering a desk cluttered with devices related to the
          operation and/or use of the MRI. Clicking on either the red or the
          green plane will take you to a 2D page which provides more detailed
          information about the objects under that plane. The close button, a
          black <b>X</b> in the upper right corner of each 2D page, will return
          you to the main MRI Console Room scene when clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tour-how-hdr">Navigation:</span>
          On the floor of 3D scenes, you may notice black discs with double arrows.
          Clicking on one of these will navigate you to the next or previous scene.
        </p>

        <h3>About The Tour</h3>
        <p>
          This virtual tour was developed by
          <a href="https://profiles.arizona.edu/person/dkp">Dr. Dianne Patterson</a>,
          of the <a href="https://www.bic.arizona.edu/">Brain Imaging Center (BIC)</a>,
          and Tom Hicks, in the
          <a href="https://ischool.arizona.edu/">School of Information</a>.
          We are grateful to the
          <a href="https://sensorlab.arizona.edu/">RII Sensor Lab</a>, for the loan
          of several 360 cameras, and to Devin Bayly, of UITS, for providing us with
          example AFrame code to jumpstart our learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tour is implemented using HTML, Javascript, the
          <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> frontend toolkit, and the
