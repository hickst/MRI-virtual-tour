At the opening of the bore, you can see two different coils, which are antennas that receive radio frequencies from your body and transmit data to the computer. The head coil (white) is a hard coil that fits like a cage around the participant's head. The red coil is soft and lies on top of the participant. We have a variety of different coils for different body parts."
