When completely out of the magnet, the table may also be moved vertically.<br/>Participant comfort is very important to minimizing movement and participants are made more comfortable with a variety of soft supports (e.g., for raising the knees, supporting the neck, or cushioning the head)."

Note the Scanner room's copper shielding showing around the panel edge and the three copper tubes (top center and bottom left & right) for passing cables through. The copper tubes are carefully designed so that problem radio frequencies are blocked.",

Materials include plastics, salt solutions, silicones, epoxy, polyurethane foams, carbon powder, water, radioactive substances, and even absorbant polymers like those used in disposable diapers. Because phantoms have known qualities, they are scanned on a regular basis to provide quality control for tuning the scanner.",

    "body": "The head coil, sometimes called a birdcage coil, is used for neuroimaging. A coil is plugged in to the scanner and acts like an antenna. It receives radio signals from your body and transmits data to the computer to construct the image. A mirror on the top of the head coil allows the participant to see the task display for experiments that involve visual stimuli. The plug-box that is used to attach the coil to the scanner table is visible in the picture (white box/pipe at bottom left of photo).",
