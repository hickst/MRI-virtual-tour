Its HD resolution (1900 x 1200 at 60Hz) is identical to the monitor in the console room and the two displays are cloned. However, using a specialized SD card, the image is left-right flipped so that it can be viewed by the participant through a mirror located on top of the head coil.<br/>Model Name: Cambridge Research Systems BOLDscreen MRI-compatible display."

The window contains an embedded metal mesh to block stray radio signals into and out of the scanner room. The patch panel, directly below the window, allows cables to be connected from the console room to the scanner room while blocking unwanted radio frequencies."
