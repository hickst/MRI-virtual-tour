Its HD resolution (1900 x 1200 at 60Hz) is identical to the monitor in the console room and the two displays are cloned. However, using a specialized SD card, the image is left-right flipped so that it can be viewed by the participant through a mirror located on top of the head coil.<br/>Model Name: Cambridge Research Systems BOLDscreen MRI-compatible display."
