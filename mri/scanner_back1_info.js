    "body": "This positionable trolley holds a 24-inch HD monitor and has an eye-tracking camera resting on top of it. The display is used for presenting visual stimuli and a custom aluminum enclosure makes it MR-compatible. Its HD resolution (1900 x 1200 at 60Hz) is identical to the monitor in the console room and the two displays are cloned. However, using a specialized SD card, the image on this display is left-right flipped so that it can be viewed by the participant through a mirror located on top of the head coil.<br/><br/>Model Name: Cambridge Research Systems BOLDscreen MRI-compatible display."

    "body": "This closet contains a breast coil (sitting on top of a small ladder) and gear for Magnetic Resonance Elastography (the white plastic disc, grey tubes, and device in recess above). MRE is a technology that combines MRI imaging with low-frequency vibrations to create a visual map (elastogram) that shows the stiffness of body tissues. Also, note the exposed copper barrier, which sheaths the entire Scanner room."

    "title": "MRI-Safe Gurney",
    "image": "../images/sb1_gurney.jpg",
    "body": "This gurney can be used to remove a participant from the MR scanner room in case of an emergency. For example, if a participant had a heart attack you would want to remove them from the scanner room so that EMTs would not have to work around the strong magnetic field."

  "controlWindow": {
    "title": "Control Room Window",
    "body": "The control room window allows the MRI technician to monitor activities in the scanner room while sitting at the operater's console. The window contains an embedded metal mesh to block stray radio signals into and out of the scanner room. The patch panel, directly below the window, allows cables to be connected from the console room to the scanner room while blocking unwanted radio frequencies."
